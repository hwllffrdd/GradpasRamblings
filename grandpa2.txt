We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere - like the time I  caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to  take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of  bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say. Ah, there's an interesting story behind that nickel.
