My story begins in nineteen-dickety-two. We had to say dickety because  the Kaiser had stolen our word twenty. I chased that rascal to get it  back, but gave up after dickety-six miles. Then after World War Two, it  got kinda quiet, 'til Superman challenged FDR to a race around the world. FDR beat him by a furlong or so the comic books would have  you believe. The truth lies somewhere in between. Three wars back we  called Sauerkraut "liberty cabbage" and we called liberty cabbage "super  slaw" and back then a suitcase was known as a "Swedish lunchbox."
